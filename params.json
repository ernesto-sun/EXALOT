Until then the use and understanding of EXALOT might be tricky for a newcomer. If you are willing to contribute you are welcome to get a personal intro. Maybe you want to be an early bird. I am looking forward in any case!!\r\n\r\nHere you see some EXALOT-syntax. Actually the most basic one, the EXALOT-core. Just to give you a taste.\r\n```\r\n[[\"undefined\",\"defined\"]],\r\n[[\"defined\",\"b\"]],\r\n[[\"b\",\"x\"],\"defined\"],\r\n[[\"b\",\"noo\"],\"undefined\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nUntil the first release in autumn 2015 just contact me.
