EXALOT is a semantic language, designed to communicate meaning between computers and humans. It can be used to express some specific business-logic, a game, or even to build up a whole model of reality. Server-side is a RESTful API for data and logic. Client-side is a mobile-ready HTML5-app.

## Technical Details

The first release is realized as flat PHP-code providing a REST-like interface. (stateless but slightly different to common REST-practise by default, optionally REST-full)

The only server-side entry-point is api.php

Clean and full documentation is under construction.

Note: The first release is planned autumn 2015
